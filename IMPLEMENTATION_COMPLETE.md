# Compose TV Shows Screen - Implementation Summary

## âœ… Completed Implementation

I have successfully converted the TV screen from Leanback components to Jetpack Compose for TV using the Immersive List pattern, matching the movie screen architecture. Here's what has been implemented:

### ðŸŽ¯ Core Components

1. **ComposeTvShowsScreen.kt** - Main Compose UI with immersive list layout
2. **ComposeTvShowsViewModel.kt** - Business logic and data management
3. **ComposeTvShowsFragment.kt** - Fragment wrapper for navigation integration

### ðŸ“± TV Navigation Flow Implemented

**TV Shows â†’ Seasons â†’ Episodes**

The screen provides multiple content sections optimized for TV viewing:

- **Continue Watching**: Episodes user has started but not finished
- **Next Up**: Next episodes to watch for series in progress  
- **Latest Episodes**: Recently added episodes
- **All TV Series**: Main grid showing all series (vertical grid layout)
- **Favorite Series**: User's favorite TV series

### ðŸ”§ Integration Points

1. **Feature Flag**: `ENABLE_COMPOSE_TVSHOWS = true` in ComposeFeatureFlags.kt
2. **Navigation**: Added `composeTvShowsBrowser()` destination
3. **Item Launcher**: Updated to use Compose when feature flag enabled
4. **Dependency Injection**: Registered ComposeTvShowsViewModel in AppModule.kt

### ðŸŽ¨ UI/UX Features

- **Immersive List Pattern**: Matches movie screen design consistency
- **TV-Optimized Layouts**: Horizontal cards for episodes, vertical grid for series
- **Backdrop Integration**: Dynamic background images based on focused content
- **Loading/Error States**: Proper loading, error, and empty state handling
- **Material 3 Theming**: Modern TV interface with JellyfinTvTheme

### ðŸ”„ Navigation Logic

```kotlin
// Series selection -> Navigate to series details (seasons)
BaseItemKind.SERIES -> navigationRepository.navigate(Destinations.itemDetails(item.id))

// Season selection -> Navigate to season details (episodes)  
BaseItemKind.SEASON -> navigationRepository.navigate(Destinations.itemDetails(item.id))

// Episode selection -> Navigate to playback or episode details
BaseItemKind.EPISODE -> navigationRepository.navigate(Destinations.itemDetails(item.id))
```

### ðŸš€ Activation

To enable the new Compose TV Shows screen:

1. Set `ComposeFeatureFlags.ENABLE_COMPOSE_TVSHOWS = true`
2. The TV Shows library will automatically use the new Compose implementation
3. Falls back to Leanback when disabled for backwards compatibility

### âœ¨ Benefits

- **Modern TV Interface**: Compose for TV with smooth animations
- **Rich Content Discovery**: Multiple content sections with smart categorization
- **Consistent Experience**: Follows same patterns as Compose Movies screen
- **TV-Optimized**: Designed specifically for 10-foot TV viewing experience
- **Backwards Compatible**: Feature flag allows safe rollout

### ðŸ“‹ Verification

All components verified and integrated:
- âœ… All files created and properly structured
- âœ… Feature flag implemented
- âœ… Navigation integration complete
- âœ… Dependency injection configured
- âœ… TV-specific content sections implemented
- âœ… Navigation flow handling for Series/Season/Episode

The implementation is complete and ready for testing! Users will experience a modern, immersive TV interface that seamlessly handles the TV Shows â†’ Seasons â†’ Episodes navigation flow while maintaining full compatibility with the existing application architecture.
