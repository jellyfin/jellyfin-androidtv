      description: Describe the issue you are experiencing or the gap you are trying to address.
      placeholder: |
        At the moment, the Android TV Client does not support displaying lyrics during music playback, while the Jellyfin Web client does.
        This creates an inconsistent user experience across platforms.

      description: Provide a detailed description of what you would like to see implemented or changed.
      placeholder: |
        The Client could display lyrics as an overlay on the screensaver, synchronized with the songâ€™s progress. Additionally, a scrolling lyrics section could be integrated into the mini-player, ensuring the lyrics are easily readable without obstructing playback controls.

      description: Outline any other approaches you have thought about or explored to solve the problem.
      placeholder: |
        An alternative approach could involve adding a dedicated "Lyrics" button in the Android TV Client, similar to the Jellyfin Web client.
        Users could press this button to open a full-screen lyrics view. This option could cater to users who prefer controlling when and how they see lyrics, without adding overlays to existing interfaces.
