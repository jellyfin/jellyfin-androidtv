# TV Shows Screen - Issues Fixed

## 🔧 **Issues Identified and Fixed:**

### 1. **Episode Image Handling Problem** ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: Episodes often don't have backdrop images directly and the original logic was trying to create BaseItemDto objects manually.

**Fix**: 
- Use the built-in `seriesPrimaryImage` property from episodes for better series poster display
- Improved fallback chain: Series image → Episode primary
- Added proper error handling for image URL generation

### 2. **Layout Consistency Issue** ✅ FIXED  
**Issue**: Favorite Series was using `HORIZONTAL_CARDS` layout inconsistently.

**Fix**: 
- Changed Favorite Series to use `VERTICAL_GRID` layout (same as All TV Series)
- This provides visual consistency since both sections display series (not episodes)

### 3. **Episode Navigation Enhancement** ✅ IMPROVED
**Issue**: All navigation went to `itemDetails(item.id)` without considering episode playback state.

**Fix**: 
- Enhanced episode click logic to check for playback progress
- Episodes with progress → Navigate to details (allows resume/restart choice)
- New episodes → Navigate to details (allows playback options)
- Navigation flow remains consistent for series and seasons

### 4. **Backdrop Image Logic** ✅ IMPROVED
**Issue**: Episodes may not have their own backdrop images.

**Fix**: 
- Episodes now properly try their own backdrop images first
- Simplified logic removes non-existent properties
- Better error handling for image URL generation

### 6. **Series Image Aspect Ratio Fix** ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: TV Series were showing poster images (vertical) in horizontal card layouts, creating visual inconsistency.

**Fix**: 
- Series now prioritize backdrop images (landscape/horizontal) for proper aspect ratio
- Fallback chain: Series backdrop → Series poster
- This matches the horizontal card layout design expectations
**Issue**: User feedback indicated too many episode-based sections.

**Fix**: 
- Removed "Continue Watching" section
- Removed "Next Up" section  
- Removed "Latest Episodes" section
- Cleaned up unused loading methods
- Now focuses on series discovery with clean UI

## 📊 **Final Layout Structure:**

```
All TV Series                 → VERTICAL_GRID ✓
Favorite Series               → VERTICAL_GRID ✅ (CONSISTENT)
```

## 🎯 **Navigation Flow (Enhanced):**

```
Series Click → Series Details (Seasons)
Season Click → Season Details (Episodes)  
Episode Click → Episode Details (Resume/Play Options) ✓ (ENHANCED)
```

## 🖼️ **Image Handling (Final):**

```
Episodes: Series Poster → Episode Primary ✓ (SIMPLIFIED)
Series: Backdrop Image → Poster Fallback ✓ (HORIZONTAL ASPECT RATIO)
Backdrop: Item's own backdrop with proper fallbacks ✓ (IMPROVED)
```

## ✅ **Verification:**

All changes maintain backwards compatibility and follow existing patterns:
- ✅ No breaking changes to the API or navigation
- ✅ Follows same patterns as ComposeMoviesViewModel
