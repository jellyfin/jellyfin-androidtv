# Enhanced Cherry-Pick Conflict Detection System

This enhanced system provides automated conflict detection, smart recommendations, and GitHub Actions integration for predicting cherry-pick conflicts in forked repositories.

## 🚀 New Features

### 1. GitHub Actions Integration
Automated conflict detection workflows that run on:
- **Manual triggers** - Analyze specific commits on demand
- **Pull requests** - Check PR commits for conflict potential
- **Scheduled runs** - Daily checks for new upstream commits

### 2. Smart Recommendations System
AI-powered analysis that provides:
- **Risk scoring** (0-100 scale)
- **Context-aware recommendations**
- **Conflict resolution strategies**
- **Best practice suggestions**

### 3. Enhanced Output Formats
- **JSON output** for CI/CD integration
- **Detailed text reports** with actionable insights
- **GitHub Actions summaries** with visual indicators

## 📋 Usage Guide

### Basic Enhanced Analysis
```bash
# Run enhanced analysis with smart recommendations
./check_cherry_pick_conflicts_enhanced.sh <commit-hash>

# Analyze against specific branch
./check_cherry_pick_conflicts_enhanced.sh <commit-hash> develop

# Get JSON output for automation
./check_cherry_pick_conflicts_enhanced.sh <commit-hash> --json
```

### GitHub Actions Workflows

#### Manual Conflict Check
1. Go to **Actions** tab in your repository
2. Select **Cherry-Pick Conflict Detection**
3. Click **Run workflow**
4. Enter the commit hash to analyze
5. View results in the workflow summary

#### Automated PR Analysis
- Automatically runs on all pull requests
- Analyzes each commit in the PR
- Provides conflict assessment in PR checks

#### Daily Upstream Monitoring
- Runs daily at 2 AM UTC
- Checks last 24 hours of upstream commits
- Alerts on potential conflicts

## 🎯 Risk Assessment System

### Risk Levels

**LOW (0-19 points)**
- ✅ Safe to cherry-pick
- Minimal conflict potential
- Standard precautions sufficient

**MEDIUM (20-49 points)**
- ⚠️ Moderate risk
- Review recommended
- Test in separate branch

**HIGH (50+ points)**
- ❌ High conflict risk
- Manual intervention likely
- Expert review required

### Scoring Factors

| Factor | Points | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Merge-tree conflicts | +40 | Direct three-way merge conflicts detected |
| Recent file modifications | +15 | Same files modified within 7 days |
| Large commits (>100 lines) | +20 | Extensive changes increase conflict risk |
| Build file changes | +15 | Dependencies/configuration modifications |
| Code file modifications | +5 | Java/Kotlin/XML changes |

## 💡 Smart Recommendations

### Low Risk Recommendations
- ✅ Safe to cherry-pick - Low conflict risk
- 💡 Consider cherry-picking during off-peak hours
- 📝 Document the cherry-pick in your commit message

### Medium Risk Recommendations
- ⚠️ Moderate conflict risk - proceed with caution
- 🔍 Review the modified files before cherry-picking
- 🧪 Test in a separate branch first
- 👥 Consider having a team member review the changes

### High Risk Recommendations
- ❌ High conflict risk - manual intervention likely needed
- 🛠️ Prepare for manual conflict resolution
- 📋 Create a backup branch before attempting
- 🔄 Consider rebasing your branch first
- 👨‍💻 Have an experienced developer handle this cherry-pick

### Context-Specific Recommendations
- ⚙️ Build files modified - verify dependencies after cherry-pick
- 📦 Large commit detected - consider splitting into smaller changes
- 🔄 Multiple recent modifications - consider updating your branch first

## 🔧 GitHub Actions Setup

### Prerequisites
1. Repository with GitHub Actions enabled
2. Access to upstream repository
3. Proper permissions for workflow execution

### Workflow Configuration
The workflow file `.github/workflows/cherry-pick-conflict-check.yml` provides:

- **Automatic upstream tracking**
- **Conflict analysis reporting**
- **Artifact storage** (30-day retention)
- **Summary generation** with visual indicators

### Customization Options
```yaml
# Modify schedule (currently daily at 2 AM UTC)
schedule:
  - cron: '0 2 * * *'

# Change upstream repository
git remote add upstream https://github.com/your-upstream/repo.git

# Adjust analysis depth
git log upstream/master --since="24 hours ago" --pretty=format:"%H" | head -5
```

## 📊 JSON Output Format

```json
{
  "commit_hash": "abc123def",
  "target_branch": "master",
  "conflict_score": 25,
  "risk_level": "MEDIUM",
  "analysis": {
    "merge_tree_conflicts": false,
    "recent_modifications": 2,
    "large_commit": false,
    "code_files_modified": true,
    "build_files_modified": false
  },
  "recommendations": [
    "⚠️ Moderate conflict risk - proceed with caution",
    "🔍 Review the modified files before cherry-picking",
    "🧪 Test in a separate branch first"
  ],
  "timestamp": "2025-06-20T20:30:00Z"
}
```

## 🔄 Integration Examples

### CI/CD Pipeline Integration
```bash
# Check conflict score in pipeline
SCORE=$(./check_cherry_pick_conflicts_enhanced.sh $COMMIT --json | jq '.conflict_score')
if [ $SCORE -gt 50 ]; then
  echo "High conflict risk - manual review required"
  exit 1
fi
```

### Automated Cherry-Pick Workflow
```bash
# Smart cherry-pick with risk assessment
RISK=$(./check_cherry_pick_conflicts_enhanced.sh $COMMIT --json | jq -r '.risk_level')
case $RISK in
  "LOW")
    git cherry-pick $COMMIT
    ;;
  "MEDIUM")
    echo "Creating test branch for medium-risk cherry-pick"
    git checkout -b test-cherry-pick-$COMMIT
    git cherry-pick $COMMIT
    ;;
  "HIGH")
    echo "High risk detected - manual intervention required"
    exit 1
    ;;
esac
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Workflow Permission Errors**
- Ensure `GITHUB_TOKEN` has proper permissions
- Check repository settings for Actions access

**Upstream Access Issues**
- Verify upstream repository URL
- Ensure public repository or proper authentication

**Script Execution Errors**
- Confirm script permissions: `chmod +x *.sh`
- Check git repository state and remotes

### Debug Mode
```bash
# Enable verbose output
set -x
./check_cherry_pick_conflicts_enhanced.sh $COMMIT

# Check git configuration
git remote -v
git status
```

## 📈 Performance Optimization

### Caching Strategies
- Use GitHub Actions cache for git data
- Store analysis results for repeated queries
- Implement incremental analysis for large repositories

### Batch Processing
```bash
# Analyze multiple commits efficiently
for commit in $(git log upstream/master --since="1 week ago" --pretty=format:"%H"); do
  ./check_cherry_pick_conflicts_enhanced.sh $commit --json >> batch_results.json
done
```
